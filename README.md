Hello, 
This is a Website that I developed using Databind and ASPX on Visual Studio
It is about a Car Company.All of this was coded using ASPX,C# and CSS and also involves databinding. 
It includes several interactive elements and textboxes as well as other elements. A little bit of CSS is also used to make it look better
You can choose different types of elements for the car and the final price will show up on the right side.
